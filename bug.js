This error typically occurs when you try to import a module that isn't properly installed or isn't accessible within your Expo project's environment.  It might manifest in different ways, like a missing module error, an import error, or an error during build or runtime.  The exact message can vary depending on the module and the way you're using it. For example, let's say you have a module named 'my-module' and you are importing it like this:
```javascript
import something from 'my-module';
```
If `my-module` isn't installed or is in the wrong location, you'll get an error like this:
`Error: Cannot find module 'my-module'`
