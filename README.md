# Intermittent 'Module not found' Error in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in the Expo CLI where a module import fails, even though the module is correctly installed and the import path is accurate. The error occurs intermittently and is challenging to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

The core issue is that an `Error: Cannot find module '...'` message is thrown despite the necessary modules being present in the project's `node_modules` directory and the import statements seemingly correct.

## Reproduction Steps

The exact steps to reproduce are unreliable, as the issue seems to be triggered sporadically. However, some actions which have been associated with the error's appearance include:

* Running the app on different devices/emulators.
* Making code changes and restarting the development server.
* Running `expo prebuild` or similar commands.

## Solution

The provided solution in `bugSolution.js` offers a workaround involving a package reinstallation with additional caching cleanup and verification steps. This approach is not an ideal fix, but has proven successful in mitigating the problem, in most cases.

## Additional Notes

This issue might be linked to caching mechanisms within Expo, node module resolution or even underlying issues with the project's configuration. Further investigation may be needed to determine the root cause.
